        <em>
          The M416 is by far the most loved gun in the game its used for close
          range,mid rage and even long range thats why its the most loved gun in
          the game its used by everybody <br />
          The HK416, (referred to as the M416 in-game) is an assault
          rifle/carbine type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. A tactical rifle based on
          the discontinued XM8-project as an improvement of both the M16/AR-15
          and the M4 Carbine, it integrates the short-stroke gas piston system
          from the G36 rifle for less recoil and increased reliability. Adopted
          by the militaries of several countries across the world, in
          BATTLEGROUNDS it proves very popular due to the number of attachments
          it can accept, allowing a great amount of flexibility.

        <em>
          The AKM (Russian: Автома́т Кала́шникова модернизи́рованный, tr. Avtomát
          Kalášnikova modernizírovannyj, lit. 'Kalashnikov's Automatic Rifle
          Modernised') is an assault rifle designed by Soviet small arms
          designer Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1959. It is the most ubiquitous rifle
          of the Kalashnikov rifles. It was developed as replacement to AK-47
          introduced a decade prior. Introduced into service with the Soviet
          Army in 1959, the AKM is the prevalent variant of the entire AK series
          of firearms and it has found widespread use with most member states of
          the former Warsaw Pact and its African and Asian allies as well as
          being widely exported and produced in many other countries. The
          production of these rifles was carried out at both the Tula Arms Plant
          and Izhmash. It was officially replaced in Soviet frontline service by
          the AK-74 in the late 1970s, but remains in use worldwide. The AKM
          maintains the AK-47's wood stock, but has simpler individual parts
          that are favorable for mass production. Like the AK-47, many variants
          of the AKM exist such as the AKMS, AKML, and AKMP.

        <h2>THE AWM</h2>

      <p>
        <em>
          The AWM is a powerful bolt action rifle designed for extreme range
          sharpshooting. Dealing the highest amount of damage out of any gun in
          the game, it is also one of only two ranged weapons (the other being
          the crossbow) capable of killing any player in one shot to the head,
          even if the victim is wearing a Spetsnaz helmet. At distances beyond
          500 meters, it becomes the only gun in the game that can kill players
          in one shot to the head. The long reload, time between shots, high
          damage and unique ammo all represent the high risk, high reward
          gameplay that requires the user to have patience and a steady aim,
          moving position quickly after firing, lest other players recognizing
          the firing sound of the AWM attempt to close in to take the weapon for
          themselves. The AWM will deal maximum damage out to 150 meters, with
          maximum damage falloff at 679 meters.
